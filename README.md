# Website Kickstarter for Herbie CMS

## Installation 

You can start your new Herbie CMS website by using Composer.

For the upcoming 2.x version with PHP 7.4, 8.0, 8.1:

    composer create-project getherbie/start-website:dev-master mywebsite

For the stable 1.x version with PHP 5.x only:

    composer create-project getherbie/start-website mywebsite 

This will install a simple demo website and all required dependencies.

## Run website using built-in web server

In your terminal go to the web directory and start the built-in web server.

    cd mywebsite/web
    php -S localhost:8888 index.php

Now, open <http://localhost:8888> with your browser.
Thatâ€™s all it takes!

If you need additional console output or logging information, set the debug environment variable.

    HERBIE_DEBUG=1 php -S localhost:8888 index.php

If you want to debug using Xdebug (3.x), start the web server as follows.

    XDEBUG_MODE=debug php -S localhost:8888 index.php

For this to work, Xdebug must of course be installed.

## Run website using Docker

The Docker configuration files can be found here:

```
docker-compose.yml
docker
    - nginx
        - app.conf
docker
    - php
        - Dockerfile
        - php.ini
```

Start the Docker container by using `docker-compose up -d` in the root directory of the website.

Then, open <http://0.0.0.0:8888> in your browser.
