# Website Kickstarter for Herbie CMS

## Using PHP

### Installation

You can start your new Herbie CMS website by using Composer.

    composer create-project getherbie/start-website mywebsite

This will install a simple demo website and all required dependencies.

### Run website

In your terminal go to the web directory and start the built-in web server.

    cd mywebsite/web
    php -S localhost:8888 index.php

Now, open <http://localhost:8888> with your browser.
Thatâ€™s all it takes!

If you need additional console output or logging information, set the debug environment variable.

    HERBIE_DEBUG=1 php -S localhost:8888 index.php

If you want to debug using Xdebug (3.x), start the web server as follows.

    XDEBUG_MODE=debug php -S localhost:8888 index.php

For this to work, Xdebug must of course be installed.
