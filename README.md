# Website Kickstarter for Herbie CMS

With the Kickstarter, you can create a new website in no time, install all dependencies and launch the website in your development environment.

## Supported PHPÂ Versions

8.0 / 8.1 / 8.2 / 8.3

## Launch Website Using PHP and Composer

Create project and install dependencies.

    composer create-project getherbie/start-website mywebsite

Go to the `web` directory and start PHPs built-in web server.

    cd mywebsite/web
    php -S localhost:8888 index.php

Open <http://localhost:8888> with your browser.

If you need additional console output or logging information, set the debug environment variable.

    HERBIE_DEBUG=1 php -S localhost:8888 index.php

If you want to debug using Xdebug (3.x), start the web server as follows.

    XDEBUG_MODE=debug php -S localhost:8888 index.php

For this to work, Xdebug must of course be installed.
